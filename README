DESCRIPTION

Storylinenews is a web mining utility that scrapes major newsfeeds to form a
consensus of the most important topics based on the most-discussed terms. It 
combines this information with sentiment analysis to determine the overall 
tone of coverage on each topic.

DEPENDENCIES

The project requires version 1.5 of Pattern:
http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern

and the SentiWordNet polarity lexicon (sign up for a research license):
http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/


INSTRUCTIONS

First install SentiWordNet. It goes in $(PATTERNDIR)/en/wordnet.

Run scraper.py with the location of a feed list as the first argument.

> python scraper.py feeds.json


FEED LIST FORMAT

The feed list is a JSON string dump of a dict of the form

{'FEEDNAME':'feedurl'}

where feedurl points to an RSS or Atom feed.
